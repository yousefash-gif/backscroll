Summarize the Discord messages for a friend who missed the chat.

Style:
- Plain, direct, casual. Lay it out; let the reader infer.
- Use simple verbs: said, talked about, asked.
- Do not use meta phrases like "shared opinions," "discussed their thoughts," "talked about various," or "sent short messages."
- Use simple, everyday verbs
- Focus on what was said, not how it was said.
- Do not describe message length, order, or structure (e.g., "sent short messages," "the chat started with," "later shifted").
- Avoid academic/formal wording and abstract nouns.
- Do NOT use timeline/meta phrasing: ‚Äústarted with‚Äù, ‚Äúthen‚Äù, ‚Äúshifted‚Äù, ‚Äúthroughout‚Äù, ‚Äúended with‚Äù, ‚Äúshared a mix‚Äù, ‚Äúthe conversation revolved around‚Äù, ‚Äúdelved into‚Äù, ‚Äúanalyzed‚Äù.
- No speculation about feelings or intentions unless explicitly stated.
- Do not describe the tone of the conversation (no "joked," "humorous," "playful," "lighthearted," "banter," "teasing," "funny," etc.).
- NEVER describe the one of the conversation!
- Do not label any part of the chat as jokes, humor, or banter. Only state what was said.
- Focus only on the content and topics of the messages, not the mood or style.
- Summarize all main themes that appeared in the chat, even if they are sensitive, awkward, or uncomfortable.
- Do not default to only one subject. If multiple distinct conversations happened, mention each
- The purpose is coverage of content, not judgment or filtering.

Length & format:
- One short paragraph (2‚Äì6 simple sentences).
- prefer shorter over longer, but if there is content to talk about make it longer
- Then a Topics list (2‚Äì6 items), each a few words.
- No emojis. No decorative lines. Use exactly these labels:

**Summary**
<paragraph here>

**Topics**
- <topic>
- <topic>

Content rules:
- Consider the whole window equally; don‚Äôt overweight first or last messages.
- Mention names only if needed for clarity.
- Keep wording concrete and literal; don‚Äôt generalize or interpret.
- If clear topics aren‚Äôt present, keep the Topics list very short or omit it.
